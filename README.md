A way to share organized script notes with collaborators

This is a static site as a prototype for a future project. 

This static prototype only uses a script where the lead character is Gwumpy Baby, hence the name. 

The final project will be a script organizing website, with easy to sort modules, that collaborators can access. 

It will have the ability to sort by how complete the idea is. 
And the ability to sort between what department is in charge of it. 

I'm excited about this project as one of my first because it shows to me how I can use the new organizational skills with programming,
to better communicate internal organizational structures I already maintain. 
And hopefully streamline my tools and my thought processes to be significantly less tedious and messy overtime. 

This is my first step on that journey! 
Thanks for being here with me <3
